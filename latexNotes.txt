Color:

   Both LaTeXMathML and HTML allow the use of color. In LaTeXMathML, non-math text is colored using

   \textcolor{TheColor}{text to be colored}.

   For example, this text is blue and this text is magenta . The background of non-math text is colored using

   \colorbox{TheColor}{text to be background colored}.

   This is sometimes known as Highlighting!

    
   The textcolor and undefined commands can be used inside of equations. Also, the color of an entire equation can be set using the ommand inside the equation. For example, the LaTeX code

   \[ \int \color{#8F001A} _a ^b f^{\prime}(x)\, dx = f(b) - f(a), 
   \qquad \textcolor{pinegreen}{\colorbox{yellow}{FTOC I}} \]

   is rendered as
   abf(x)dx=f(b)-f(a),FTOCI
   A list of allowable color names is included in the appendix. No error checking to insure valid colors is performed.
